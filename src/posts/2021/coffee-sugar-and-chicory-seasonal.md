## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

 When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown *Bookmarksgrove*, the headline of [Alphabet Village](https://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.

```ts whatever
function greet(name: string) {
	console.log(`Hey ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`)
}
```

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with [Longe and Parole](https://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasnâ€™t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

> Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

1. So baboon this
2. Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3. Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4. Rash opossum less because less some amid besides
5. yikes jeepers frenetic impassive fruitlessly shut
